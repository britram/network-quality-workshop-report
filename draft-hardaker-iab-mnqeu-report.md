# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop was held
virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in September, 2021.
This workshop summarizes the workshop, the topics discussed and some
preliminary conclusions drawn at the end of the workshop.
